## About me

An accomplished sociologist and certified web designer, I have been involved in online marketing for more than a decade. 
Working on educational apps as well as UI/UX design is my passion. When I am free I enjoy spending time with my son and reading. 
My curiosity and interest in self-development make me an autodidact. 
In my opinion, Roosevelt's quote most accurately describes my life philosophy: 
> Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. >
